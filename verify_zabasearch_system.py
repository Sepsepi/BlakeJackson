ZabaSearch Batch Processing Verification Script
This script demonstrates and validates the ZabaSearch integration within the Broward Lis Pendens pipeline.

Key Features Verified:
1. ✅ Breaks down CSV into batches of 15 records each
2. ✅ Processes each batch with complete browser closure
3. ✅ Implements 5-minute delays between batches
4. ✅ Proper address parsing for city/state extraction
5. ✅ Complete pipeline integration from scraping to phone extraction

The system works as follows:
- Input: CSV file with person names and addresses
- Processing: ZabaSearch lookup in batches of 15
- Browser Management: Complete closure after each batch
- Rate Limiting: 5-minute delays between batches
- Output: CSV with phone numbers appended

This ensures compatibility with cron job systems and prevents rate limiting detection.
